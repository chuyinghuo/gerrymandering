# gerrymandering
Create some type of double(multi) modal density that you can scale somehow to make it harder/easier to sample (double-well potential energy)
Look at the number of samples you need to converge to the correct observables (e.g. mean/covariances) as a function of this parameter
Use this to set up a parallel tempering algorithm
